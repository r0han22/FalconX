Hi Strangers, 

My name is Rohan and if you're reading this you are probably evaluating my submission for the Quant Analyst Internship at Flaconx. 

# Instructions to Run 
To run the code, upload `RohansSubmission.ipynb` and `dataset.json` into the Jupyter Notebook. Since the main file is in a .ipynb it will run without a problem. 


If you want to run the code locally (I don't recommend doing this), I have also included a submission.py file. Download this file along with the dataset(`dataset.json`) and use `python submission.py` to run it. You will require NumPy, pandas, and mathplotlib on your system. 

# Note:
I've also included the dataset as a .csv(`dataset_in_csv_format.csv`) file and TheGraphQL query I used to fetch the data. These 2 files are not required to run the program and I've included them for the reader's reference.
